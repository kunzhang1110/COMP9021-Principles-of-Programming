# Reads from a file named tree.txt, containing numbers expected to be organised as a tree,
# a number at a depth of N in the tree being preceded with N tabs in the file.
# The file can also contain any number of lines with nothing but blank lines.
# Uses the module general_tree.py to build the tree represented in the file
# (outputs an error message in case the representation is incorrect),
# and prints it out using the same representation as in the file.
