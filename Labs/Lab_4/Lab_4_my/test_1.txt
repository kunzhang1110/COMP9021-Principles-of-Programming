The Kiwis were the tournaments gallants, but this day were
overwhelmed, perhaps by the occasion,
certainly by Australia¡¯s brand of cricket forte.
Plan B ? sans McCullum¡¯s salvo ? had worked against
other attacks, but not the Australians¡¯ lair of limber lefties.
Beforehand, speculation centred on how the Kiwis,
playing away from their compact homelands
for the first time in the tournament, would deal
with the vastness of the MCG. Now, though, the problem
was not that the boundaries were too far away,
but the bowlers too close. Starc, and after him Mitch Johnson,
and must have looked like fishtailing trucks
coming towards them, with Josh Hazlewood swerving
from the other direction in the next lane.
"Our bowlers won us the World Cup," Clarke would aver later.
After six weeks of batting hit-and-giggle,
bowlers had the last laugh. They always do.
