Chevron¡¯s decision to sell its 50 per cent stake in
Caltex Australia will make it easier for the local fuel
supplier to release franking credits to shareholders,
Caltex chief financial officer Simon Hepworth says.
Speaking after the $4.6 billion block sale, Caltex management
sought to assure investors that the company¡¯s
broader business strategy would be unchanged, despite the
departure of its US-domiciled major shareholder,
which has held its stake for 40 years.
But Mr Hepworth conceded the deployment of the company¡¯s
$1.1 billion franking credit balance could be
made easier by the transaction, given that as a US-based
shareholder, the return of franking credits was
not available to Chevron.
